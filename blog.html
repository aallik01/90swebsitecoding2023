<h1 class="cody">Ive been playing this game for weeks at the arcade and I cant stop playing or thinking about it, im stuck on level 20 though, does anyone know how to beat it?</h1>
<h1 class="james" >user_james.fletcher</h1>
<h1 class="james">yes! @user_cody.jones, it took me so long to do almost 2 weeks but i ended up getting.</h1>
<h1 class="cody">user_cody.jones</h1>
<h1 class="cody">Omg thats crazy, I cant get passed it! No matter how many times I tried.</h1>
<h1 class="james" >user_james.fletcher</h1>
<h1 class="james">okay i got you,</h1>
<h1 class="james">So here is what your gonna do, instead of the weapon that they unlock for you in level 19, use the weapon underneath the rink on the side (its hidden, but if you move your joy stick, you'll be able to see it), then what your going to do is once you find it, you have to hit your oponent 7 times, a backflip, and hook kick him in the face causing him to fall flat on his back.</h1>
    <h1 class="cody">Wow, thank you so much dude!</h1>
    <h1 class="james">Oh but wait, I'm not done yet</h1>
    <h1 class="james">Once that happens and you think hes dead, its all a trick, he gets back up and actually stronger than before but the good thing is, with one last strike on the left side of his left leg feumer youll have beat the level!</h1>
    <h1 class="cody">Dude seriously, your a life saver, thanks bro.</h1>
    <h1 class="james">Of course.</h1>
